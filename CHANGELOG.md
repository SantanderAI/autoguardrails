## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- `autoguardrails` harness: an autoresearch-style guardrail loop that searches
  over a single mutable `policy.md` surface against a fixed evaluation suite
- CLI subcommands `baseline`, `candidate`, `evaluate`, and `status`
- Deterministic offline stub target model and heuristic frozen judge, plus an
  OpenAI-compatible transport for real-model experiments
- Protected-surface manifest that rejects any change outside `policy.md`
- Top-line metric: attack success rate (`ASR`) with a benign-pass floor
- Fixed evaluation suite (`eval_suite.jsonl`), frozen judge prompt
  (`judge_prompt.md`), and append-only run log (`results.tsv`)
- `run_autoguardrails.sh` convenience wrapper and `tests/` regression suite
